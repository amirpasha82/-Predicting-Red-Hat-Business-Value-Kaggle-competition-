# Predicting Red Hat Business Value (Kaggle competition, ended in 2016)
For more info about the data sets, etc., please refer to https://www.kaggle.com/c/predicting-red-hat-business-value.

Distributed Random Forest (DRF) is used to fit the model via h2o.ai API in R (training accuracy: 0.95, test accuracy: 0.88). This is an ongoing work, so perhaps a good idea to continue with other models such as xgboost, gbm, etc.
